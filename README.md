ClassiCube (poorly) ported to Tizen wearables.
This is just the web version of ClassiCube with a modified ClassiCube.js file to make the touch controls appear.

## What brokey?
Texture's are broken, default.zip exists but yeah nothing.

## oy readme please
This might not work on all watches, at least tizen 4.0 watches.
If your sure your watch can run Tizen 4 apps and have some knowledge with Tizen Studio, go ahead and try it!

_i might put this on the galaxy store if possible_
